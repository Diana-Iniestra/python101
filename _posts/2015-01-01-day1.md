### Getting started ###

{% comment %}
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  print("Hi, {}!".format(name))

>>> print_hi('Tom')
# Hi, Tom
{% endhighlight %}
{% endcomment %}


```python
class Foo():
	pass
```


- philosophy
- start: let's talk to python. scripts vs interactive vs notebook
- python2/3 headache
- variables, statements, expressions
- conditionals
- functions
- loops and iteration
- strings
- file I/O
