# Namespaces, modules, classes

# Modules 

- A way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter.

- Definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into your script.

- A module is a file (with the suffix `.py`) containing Python definitions and statements.

- A module can contain executable statements as well as function definitions and can import other modules.

- `dir()` function

---

# Importing

```python
import foo
foo.bar()

from foo import bar
bar()

from foo import bar, baz, spam, eggs

from foo import *  # bad practice, use sparingly!
```
---

# Scripts

Every `.py` file can be imported as a module.

In particular, when you execute a Python file as a script

```bash
$ python my_script.py

```

the code in the module will be executed, just as if you imported it, but with the `__name__` attribute of the module set to "__main__".

As a result, the "`if __name__=='__main__`" idiom lets makes a Python file usable as a module and script:

```python
# --- fibo.py ---
# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
    a, b = 0, 1
    while b < n:
        print(b, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    fib(int(sys.argv[1]))  # run the fib function on command line input

```

# The Zen

```python
>>> import this
```

```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

```

# Namespaces: a honking good idea

A _namespace_ is a mapping from names to objects. 

Examples:
- the set of built-in names (function names and exception names)
- the global names in a module
- the local names in a function invocation
- the attribute names of an object

---

# Variable scope ([LEGB rule](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_scope_and_namespaces.html))

A _scope_ is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible.

1\. **L** local

names assigned in a function (using `def` or `lambda`) and not declared global in that function.

2\. **E** enclosing function

names in the local scope of any and all enclosing functions, from inner to outer.

3\. **G** global (module-level)

names assigned at the top-level of a module file, or declared global in a function within the file using the `global` keyword

4\. **B** builtin

names preassigned as built-in names module, e.g.: `open`, `range`, `SyntaxError`, ...

# [Classes](https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/classes.html)

- Classes are the blueprints or definitions for creating (instantiating) new objects

- Objects (class instances) have both data and behavior (methods).

---

# Class definition

```
class ClassName:
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>

```

---

# Instantiation and `__init__`


---
# Class vs instance variables


---
# Methods

---
# Inheritance

---
# Private variables

---
# Exceptions are classes too!

# PyGame

# What is PyGame?

- PyGame is a wrapper around the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, written in C, which provides access to your computer's audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware.

- SDL, in turn is a wrapper around many of your Operating System's low-level graphics and multimedia functionality.

Pygame **polls** the system for events. Then we update any objects that need updating and redraw the current state of the game.
