# Lambda Expressions

Python allows for the creation of single-expression "anonymous" functions using the `lambda` keyword.

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y

```

is equivalent to:
```python
def <lambda>(x, y):
	return x + y

add = <lambda>
```

They are useful for passing small functions as arguments to other procedures.

```python
>>> pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]
>>> sorted(pairs, key=lambda pair: pair[1])
[(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]
```

# Functional primitives

- `map`

- `filter`

# Comprehensions

- List comprehensions

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

parity = ['even' for x in range(100) if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd']

```

- Set comprehensions

```python
parity = {'even' for x in range(100) if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd'}

```

- Dict comprehensions

```python
even_squares = {x:x**2 for x in range(100) if x % 2 == 0}

```
